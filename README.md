# Back End Project Week
This week you will be building a backend for a note taking app called "Lambda Notes."

You are to treat this week as if you are working at a company and the instructor is your client.  The teaching assistants are acting as your project managers and will be your main support throughout the week.

The main objective of this week is to develop a backend to support the LambdaNotes app you built during the Front End project week, connect the two projects together, and add some additional features. You will use NodeJS, MongoDB and any other technologies you have learned here at Lambda School.

## Git Commits
* You are required to showcase progress with at least 1 commit a day.  This will let your project manager know where you are and if you need help.  This also allows the client to get progress reports from the company in a real world setting. This also protects you from losing your work if your computer blows up.

## Trello Set Up:
* [ ] Use your existing Trello account from the Front End Project, or create a new one
* [ ] Create a new board called "Lambda Notes(Backend) - {Your Name}"
* [ ] Create lists titled `backlog`,`To Do`, `In Progress`, and `Done`
* [ ] Fill in the `To Do` list with the Backend MVP features listed below
* [ ] Fill in the `backlog` list with all the extra features listed below
* [ ] Share your board with the project manager that has been assigned to you.  If you have not been assigned yet, reach out to your Section Lead for guidance
* [ ] Add your Trello URL to your project's README.md file.  Commit the change, push it to your repository & submit a pull request

## Backend MVP Features:
* [ ] Create a Database for your app
* [ ] Create a Registration Page that allows users to create accounts for your app and sign in with email/password
* [ ] Store these User Accounts in your Database
* [ ] Add a Sign In Page
* [ ] Store Notes in your Database
* [ ] Deploy your application to the web

Build an API Endpoint for each of the following, and connect it to your React App. These should all be read from your Database and scoped to the logged in user. Write tests for your endpoints.
* [ ] Display a list of notes
* [ ] Create a note with a title and content
* [ ] View an existing note
* [ ] Edit an existing note
* [ ] Delete an existing note

Upon your first commit, please submit a Pull Request and add _both_ the **Trello Set Up** and **Backend MVP Features** Task lists to your first Pull Request comment:
